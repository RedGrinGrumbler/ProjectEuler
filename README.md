https://projecteuler.net/about

This repository is a collection of my solutions and walk-throughs of the problems posted on ProjectEulers website.

My goal with this repository is primarily to build up my scientific computing and data structures skills. 

I primarily write them in C++ &amp; Python, though I hope to expand into Java, JavaScript, GO, and PHP.
